# Product Catalog Integration Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Safely integrate, verify, publish, and deploy the supplied Product Catalog product editor.

**Architecture:** Install Product Catalog as an isolated Django app with new tables and staff-only routes. Preserve all legacy/public behavior, fix only review-proven defects, and apply production schema/static changes after `main` is pushed.

**Tech Stack:** Django, JavaScript, SQLite test database, production MySQL, django-compressor, Passenger.

### Task 1: Install the supplied application

**Files:** `twocomms/product_catalog/**`, `twocomms/twocomms/settings.py`, `twocomms/twocomms/urls.py`

1. Run the supplied installer from the repository root.
2. Inspect the exact diff and remove package-only artifacts.
3. Run Django checks and migration consistency checks.

### Task 2: Add regression coverage and harden confirmed defects

**Files:** `twocomms/product_catalog/tests/**` and only confirmed defective Product Catalog files.

1. Write a failing test for each reproduced defect.
2. Run each focused test and confirm failure.
3. Apply the smallest correction.
4. Run focused tests and confirm success.

### Task 3: Verify the integration

1. Run Product Catalog tests.
2. Run `manage.py check` and `makemigrations --check --dry-run`.
3. Run Python and JavaScript syntax checks and `git diff --check`.
4. Request an independent code review and resolve important findings.

### Task 4: Publish to main

1. Fetch `origin/main` and ensure the local commit can be safely based on it.
2. Stage only Product Catalog, registration, tests, and plan documents.
3. Commit and push `main`.
4. Verify `HEAD...origin/main` is `0 0`.

### Task 5: Deploy and verify production

1. Connect using an environment-provided SSH password without writing it to disk.
2. Run `git pull --ff-only origin main` on the server.
3. Run `migrate product_catalog`, full `migrate`, `check`, `collectstatic --noinput`, and `compress --force`.
4. Restart Passenger with `touch tmp/restart.txt`.
5. Confirm server HEAD, applied Product Catalog migration, staff-only route behavior, and public-site smoke responses.
