# SEO v1.0 Phase 12 (2026-05-13) — finding (M). Phase 21 ran with
# ``threshold = 3`` to mitigate the "1 review, 5★ looks sketchy"
# anti-spam concern. The deep audit (§6, §13.1.2) demonstrated that
# our PDP traffic is too thin for the catalog to ever reach 3
# approved reviews on most products before the SERP star-rating
# CTR uplift compounds — an extreme cold-start penalty. Google's
# documented contract (`schema.org/AggregateRating`) accepts
# ``reviewCount >= 1`` and the structured-data validator does NOT
# warn at low counts; the manipulation heuristic only fires when
# real-world reviews disagree with the displayed avg. Lowering the
# threshold to 1 unlocks the rich result for first-mover products
# the moment they earn a single approved review, which Search
# Console A/B testing on small e-commerce catalogues consistently
# shows yields a 5–15 % CTR uplift. The companion review-collection
# loop (Phase 13.x coupon → review) keeps quality calibrated.
