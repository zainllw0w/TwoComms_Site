"""Phase 21 (PR-4c) — review submission gating.

Single rule: a registered user can leave a review for a product only
if they have at least one ``orders.Order`` with ``payment_status='paid'``
that contains an ``OrderItem`` for the product. Guests can submit
without this check (their review still goes through moderation, and
``is_verified_purchase`` simply stays False).

Kept in a service module rather than directly on the model so the
business rule has one home and tests can patch it cleanly.
