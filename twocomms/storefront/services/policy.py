"""Single source of truth for shipping tariffs and return policy.

Phase 5 (Schema.org) refactor: previously these constants lived inline
inside ``StructuredDataGenerator`` in ``seo_utils.py``. They are now here
so the JSON-LD generator and any future delivery / returns text rendering
can share one definition.

The values intentionally match the public ``/delivery/`` and ``/returns/``
pages. Nova Poshta is the carrier; rates are weight-based brackets in UAH.
The 14-day return window is enshrined in Ukrainian consumer protection
law for goods of proper quality (see ``support_content.py`` →
``returns`` block).
